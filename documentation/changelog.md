# Changelog
This is the changelog for `casual` and all changes are listed in this document.

## [1.7.0]

### Potentially breaking changes
### CLI
- `service --list-instances` column `state`, value `remote` has changed to `external` 
   to be consistent with other CLI values. We use _internal_ and _external_, where 
   _internal_ is stuff that is known locally to the "manager", and _external_ is stuff
   that is not known locally (could still be _external_ within a domain).
- `transaction --list-instances` in the `1.6` form has changed name to `transaction --list-internal-instances`.
   `transaction --list-instances` now lists all instances of all resources, _internal_
   and _external_. This makes it consistent with _service --list-instances_.

- cli - remove extra root `domain`: casual configuration --normalize
- gateway: make gateway more robust in error situations
- xatmi: suspend involved resources during tpcall
- gateway: absorb tcp errors and only effect the relevant tcp-connection

### Changes
- `casual` has moved to GitHub

## [1.5.10] - 2022-03-21
### Fixes
- gateway: use multiplexing on the tcp-connection phase, no blocking if the
  tcp-connect takes a long time.
- cli: fix `casual domain --list-servers` to show correct number of configured instances
- transaction: fix local transaction with multiple resources
   - `casual` did not handle this correct (at all)
- domain: fix shutdown if an instance of a server has died 

## [1.5.9] - 2022-02-18
### Fixes
- discovery: propagate topology updates upstream
   - When a domain logically connects (_connector_) to another domain (_connectee_), the _connector_
     propagates `topology update` to all "it's inbounds" that has `discovery:forward true` 
     configured. Hence, enable (auto) discovery for stuff arbitrary number of _nodes_ upstream.
- gateway: "move" listeners and connectors to failed on fatal errors.
   - Listeners: on error we move the listener directly to _failed_
   - Connectors: on fatal errors we move the connection to _failed_,
      on non fatal we try again after some time (as before).
- cobol: set return status in Cobol api TPRETURN
- gateway: keep trying to connect if the logical connection fails

## [1.5.8] - 2022-01-08
### Fixes
- transaction: fix distributed transaction bug in complex topology
- queue: forward react if queue group "dies"
- xatmi: conversation disconnect not properly handled
- queue: return `no_queue` iso `no_message` when writing to non existing queue
- discovery - on discoverable::Available event: we only discover when it makes sense

### Internal
- log: made sure we only use our own stream::write and got rid of global ostream stream operator
- common - flag abstraction degradation: equality operator for underlying enum type messed up semantics

## [1.5.7] - 2021-11-26
### Fixes
- transaction: fix distributed commit when RM fails -> rollback
- discovery: registration for _discoverables_ more robust with request->reply
   - Primarily for unittests when booting, testing and shutdown of multiple domains 
     within a couple of 100ms or so.

## [1.5.6] - 2021-11-15

### Changed
- configuration: added `system` at the same level as `domain`
   - `system` holds system wide configuration, and for the time being only `system.resource` which
      replaces the _resource.properties file_ (`casual` can still handle the deprecated file though).
- cli: reverted the 'locale' awareness for the `CLI`
   - To many subtle and not to subtle problems - not worth it.
- configuration: service restrictions for servers are now treated as regex
   - If set, only services that matches at least one regex are advertised.

## [1.5.5] - 2021-11-09

### Fixes
- xatmi - conversation: major refactoring
- xatmi: fix leak of descriptors for conversational services.
- cli - configuration edit: made sure we sink the SIGCHILD signal from the spawned editor
- documentation: fixed the example configuration files
- queue: forward to remote queues did not work correctly

## [1.5.4] - 2021-10-23

### Fixes
- transaction - if rm:s report error during xa_start: reply with TPESVCERR
- configuration|cli - validate: only positive integers for instances
- cli: version information, lowercase key names, compiler version
- queue: support queue-peek in c-api

## [1.5.3] - 2021-09-22

### Fixes
- http: outbound handle discovery (_http-services_ are treated _external_ as they should)
- xatmi: support for conversations (primarily targeting COBOL)
- gateway: fixed so outbound holds unique connections per service
- discovery: service-manager only replies with _local_ services
   - **attention** if the intention is that a domain should expose services that the domain has
     found in other domains (not _local_), the domains inbound connections should have the directive
     `discovery.forward = true` set. This also applies to `http` exposed services (since they're not local)

## [1.5.2] - 2021-09-17

### Fixes
- domain: fixed so order of groups (configuration) can be arbitrary, regardless of dependencies.
- discovery: made sure we _flush send_ to mitigate deadlocks when interacting with `casual-domain-discovery`

## [1.5.1] - 2021-09-11

### Fixes
- gateway - respect hops: round-robin on the partition with smallest hops
- gateway: fix interdomain protocol example tool
- paths: made sure we do not use std::filesystem::equivalent with non existing file
- cli: improved (subjectively) event::Notification print out (new for 1.5)
- configuration: fix bug with empty aliases for gateway
- configuration: fixed bug when 'update' an _alias key_ 'entity'. We moved from the one we supposed to add to...

## [1.5.0] - 2021-09-01
### Added
- configuration: runtime configuration _stage 1_ 
  - cli for _get, post, put_, and _edit_ which spawns an editor and when the configuration is _saved_ 
    `casual` tries to conform to the (possible) new configuration.
  - **attention:** under (heavy) load there might be some noise still, we aim to fix this in _stage 2_
- cli: version information without a domain running
- cli: added option to reopen _casual.log_. 
   Prints information of all processes that `casual` are not sure can handle a `SIGHUP`, hence it easier for users
   to _automate_ log-rotation.
- cli: make `casual` cli user 'locale' aware, to play nicer with `unix` tools, such as `sort`
- cli: added value `auto` to option `--header`. With `auto`, headers are **only** used if tty is bound to stdout
- gateway: handle queue- and service information in connection state viewable in cli
- xatmi - extended: function to browse instance services
- cli: made sure wrong written cli command doesn't gives error in log
- queue - handle zombie queues: queues that are not configured anymore, but still exists in the _queuebase_
- discovery: gateway inbound discovery forward
- discovery: central 'agent' for handling discoveries

### Changed
- transcoding: platform-independent third-party-header-only-lib for base64-transcoding
- paths: using std filesystem
  - **attention:** this might change semantics which _temporary path_ is used.
  - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/temp_directory_path
  - _On POSIX systems, the path may be the one specified in the environment variables_
      _TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP, TEMPDIR, and, if none of them are specified, the path "/tmp" is returned_
- python binding: upgraded to python3


### Fixes
- serialize - some simplifications: std::filesystem::path logs correctly
- common: 'helper' for `directory::create` to handle corner cases with links
- log: made the reopen on SIGHUP more robust
- common: less semi confusing logging
- xatmi: placed definition of functions where they should be to avoid confusion
- cygwin compatibility
- build: calculate version from tags -> more robust version sequences

### Internal
- configuration - better model: all managers supply their configuration
- unittest: more deterministic unittests
- common - algorithm clean up: moved some stuff to separate headers
- build - improved and fixed some build related stuff: simplification
- maintenance - simplify traits: some improvements in algorithm
- signal: simplified signal to only have one handler for a given signal at a given time
- build: fixed problem with linking on Ubuntu
- build: turning archive to a shared library to avoid ODR
- common - strong::Type: made a strong::Type that replaces "value::id" and "value::optional"
- common: error handling and log fixes
- build - casual-make: use new build system
