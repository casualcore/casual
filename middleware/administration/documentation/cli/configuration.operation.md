configuration [0..1]
     configuration utility - does NOT actively configure anything
                    
     Used to check and normalize configuration

   SUB OPTIONS:

      --get [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [0..1]
           get current configuration

      --post [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [1]
           reads configuration from stdin and replaces the domain configuration
           
           casual will try to conform to the new configuration as smooth as possible. Although, there could be some "noise"
           depending on what parts are updated.

      --put [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [1]
           reads configuration from stdin and adds or updates parts
           
           The semantics are similar to http PUT:
           * every key that is found is treated as an update of that _entity_
           * every key that is NOT found is treated as a new _entity_ and added to the current state 

      --edit [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [0..1]
           get current configuration, starts an editor, on quit the edited configuration is posted.
           
           The editor is deduced from the following environment variables, in this order:
           * CASUAL_TERMINAL_EDITOR
           * VISUAL
           * EDITOR
           
           If none is set, `vi` is used.
           
           If no changes are detected, no update will take place.

      --enable-groups [0..1]  (<name>..) [1..*]
           INCUBATION enables groups
           Enables groups that provided group names matches.
           
           This effects entities that has memberships to enabled groups
           (domain:Server, domain:Executable, queue::Forward)
           
           @attention INCUBATION - might change during, or in between minor version.

      --disable-groups [0..1]  (<name>..) [1..*]
           INCUBATION disables groups
           Disables groups that provided group names matches.
           
           This effects entities that has memberships to enabled groups
           (domain:Server, domain:Executable, queue::Forward)
           
           @attention INCUBATION - might change during, or in between minor version.

      --normalize [0..1]  (<value>) [1..*]
           normalizes the supplied configuration glob pattern to stdout
           
           The format is default yaml, but could be supplied via the --format option

      --validate [0..1]  (<value>) [1..*]
           validates configuration from supplied glob patterns
           
           On success exit with 0, on error not 0, and message printed to stderr

      --format [0..1]  (yaml, json, ini, xml) [1]
           defines what format should be used

      --union [0..1]  (<value>) [0..*]
           union of configuration from stdin(lhs) and supplied glob pattern(rhs), outputs to stdout
              rhs has precedence over lhs
                                   
              The format is default yaml, but could be supplied via the --format option

      --difference [0..1]  (<value>) [0..*]
           difference of configuration from stdin(lhs) and supplied glob pattern(rhs), outputs to stdout
              lhs has precedence over rhs
                                   
              The format is default yaml, but could be supplied via the --format option

      --intersection [0..1]  (<value>) [0..*]
           intersection of configuration from stdin(lhs) and supplied glob pattern(rhs), outputs to stdout
              lhs has precedence over rhs
                                   
              The format is default yaml, but could be supplied via the --format option
