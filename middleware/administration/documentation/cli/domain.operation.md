      --set-environment [0..*]  (<variable>, <value>, [<alias>*]) [2..*]
            set an environment variable for explicit aliases
                                 
            if 0 aliases are provided, the environment variable will be set 
            for all servers and executables 
                                 

      --configuration-get [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [0..1]
            get current configuration

      --configuration-post [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [1]
            reads configuration from stdin and replaces the domain configuration
            
            casual will try to conform to the new configuration as smooth as possible. Although, there could be some "noise"
            depending on what parts are updated.

      --configuration-edit [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [0..1]
            get current configuration, starts an editor, on quit the edited configuration is posted.
            
            The editor is deduced from the following environment variables, in this order:
              * CASUAL_TERMINAL_EDITOR
              * VISUAL
              * EDITOR
            
            If none is set, `vi` is used.
            
            If no changes are detected, no update will take place.

      --configuration-put [0..1]  (json, yaml, xml, ini) [1]
            reads configuration from stdin and adds or updates parts
            
            The semantics are similar to http PUT:
            * every key that is found is treated as an update of that _entity_
            * every key that is NOT found is treated as a new _entity_ and added to the current state 

      --ping [0..1]  (<alias>) [1..*]
