            list current transactions

      -lr, --list-resources [0..1]
            list all resources

      --begin [0..1]
            creates a 'single' transaction directive
            
            * creates a new transaction and send it downstream.
            * all downstream `actions` will be associated with this transaction, until commit/rollback.
            * @attention there has to be a corresponding commit/rollback downstream for every 
            --begin, otherwise the transaction(s) will be unresolved (indoubt).
