transaction [0..1]
     transaction related administration

   SUB OPTIONS:

      -lt, --list-transactions [0..1]
           list current transactions

      -lr, --list-resources [0..1]
           list all resources

      -li, --list-instances [0..1]
           list all resource instances, internal and external

      --list-internal-instances [0..1]
           list details of all internal resource instances

      --list-external-instances [0..1]
           list external resource instances
           
           External resources only have one instance, hence resources and resource-instances are unambiguous.

      --begin [0..1]
           creates a 'single' transaction directive
           
           * creates a new transaction and send it downstream.
           * all downstream `actions` will be associated with this transaction, until commit/rollback.
           * @attention there has to be a corresponding commit/rollback downstream for every 
           --begin, otherwise the transaction(s) will be unresolved (indoubt).
