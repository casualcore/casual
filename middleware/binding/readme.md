binding
================================

Responsible for bindings to other languages.


Objectives
--------------------------------------------
To have bindings for at least the following languages:

* Python
* Java
* COBOL

As we do not support running casual on Windows, and we don't have any plans
for doing so in the near future, .NET bindings are only going to happen if
we target .NET core for linux and OS X.
