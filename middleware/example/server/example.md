# casual-example-server

An `XATMI` example server that provides a few general services that serves 
as an example of how to produce a server and services.

These services can also be used in test/exploration scenarios.

# services

## casual/example/echo
Returns the provided buffer
   
## casual/example/sink
Discard the provided buffer and returns a _null buffer_

## casual/example/rollback
Returns the provided buffer with `TPFAIL`

## casual/example/conversation
_same as `echo` for now_

## casual/example/uppercase
Applies `::toupper` to every byte in the buffer and returns it.

Hence, it will only make sense to provide a buffer with `X_OCTET` with string data,
or something similar


## casual/example/lowercase
Applies `::tolower` to every byte in the buffer and returns it.

Hence, it will only make sense to provide a buffer with `X_OCTET` with string data,
or something similar


## casual/example/sleep
The service `sleeps` for a fixed amount of time.

The _sleep amount_ is provided via server argument `--sleep` and the unit 
default is `seconds`, but can be provided. 

Exeample:
```
  --sleep 4
  --sleep 4s
  --sleep 1h
  --sleep 34us
  --sleep 13min 
```



## casual/example/work
The service `works` for a fixed amount of time.

The work consist of trying to utilize one core of the cpu as much as possible for
the duration of the `work` 

The _work amount_ is provided via server argument `--work` and the unit
default is `seconds`, but can be provided. 

Exeample:
```
  --work 4
  --work 4s
  --work 1h
  --work 34us
  --work 13min 
```


## casual/example/terminate
The service just calls `std::terminate`, and the server, well, _terminates_

Useful in test-/explore-cases to see what happens when a server _crashes_, what 
happens with possible transactions and so on. 

## casual/example/conversation2
Conversational service that takes data in connect 
and any it gets via tprecv, concatenates them and send
with tpsend. Then does a tpreply with a 
string representing the flags (in hex) present on service entry.
End of data from connector is indicated by the transfer of control
of the conversation to the service.
Useful to check flags passed to service and experiment with a simple
conversational service implementing an "echo style" service. 

## casual/example/conversation2_auto
Same code as casual/example/conversation2 but defined with
"transaction: auto" instead of "transaction: join".
