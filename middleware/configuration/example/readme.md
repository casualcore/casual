## configuration examples

Since the configuration in casual is represented by an object model (data structures) we
fill the object model with some representable example configuration and generate to all
format that casual knows. Hence, the information is exactly the same in the different 
formats, and you can use whichever you prefere as a reference. 

These examples are generated during build, hence shows the true configuration representation that
casual has.


### all

We're trying to show all configuration options that is possible in casual.

* [domain.yaml](domain.yaml)
* [domain.json](domain.json)
* [domain.xml](domain.xml)

### default

Shows which options has default values and what these are.

* [domain.yaml](default/domain.yaml)
* [domain.json](default/domain.json)
* [domain.xml](default/domain.xml)
