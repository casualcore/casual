# configuration gateway

[//]: # (Attention! this is a generated markdown from casual-configuration-documentation - do not edit this file!)

This is the runtime configuration for a casual domain.

The sections can be splitted in arbitrary ways, and aggregated to one configuration model `casual` uses.
Same sections can be defined in different files, hence, give more or less unlimited configuration setup.

Most of the _sections_ has a property `note` for the user to provide descriptions of the documentation. 
The examples further down uses this to make it easier to understand the examples by them self. But can of
course be used as a mean to help document actual production configuration.  



## domain.gateway

Defines configuration for communication with other `casual` domains.

### domain.gateway.inbound

Defines all inbound related configuration (from remote domains -> local domain)

#### domain.gateway.inbound.default

property                     | description
-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------
limit.size                   | default value for limit size 
limit.messages               | default value for maximum number of messages
connection.discovery.forward | default value if connections should forward discovery or not

#### domain.gateway.inbound.groups

Defines a list of all inbound groups

property       | description
---------------|----------------------------------------------------
alias          | an _identity_ for this group instance (if not set, casual generates one)
limit.size     | the maximum allowed size of all inflight messages. If reached, _inbound-group_ will stop taking more request until below the limit 
limit.messages | the maximum allowed number of inflight messages. If reached, _inbound-group_ will stop taking more request until below the limit
connections    | all the connections for this group

##### domain.gateway.inbound.groups.connection


property          | description
------------------|----------------------------------------------------
address           | the address to listen on, `host:port`
discovery.forward | boolean if the connetion should forward discovery request to 'discoverables'
exclude.services  | `[0..*]` regex patterns. During a discovery, all services that match any pattern are discarded.
exclude.queues    | `[0..*]` regex patterns. During a discovery, all queues that match any pattern are discarded.


### domain.gateway.outbound

Defines all outbound related configuration (from local domain -> remote domains)

#### domain.gateway.outbound.groups

Defines a list of all outbound groups. 

Each group gets an _order_ in the order they are defined. Groups defined lower down will only be used if the higher
ups does not provide the wanted _service_ or _queue_. Hence, the lower downs can be used as _fallback_.

property       | description
---------------|----------------------------------------------------
alias          | an _identity_ for this group instance (if not set, casual generates one)
connections    | all the connections for this group

##### domain.gateway.outbound.groups.connection

Defines all connections that this _outbound group_ should try to connect to.

All connections within a group ar treated equal, and service calls will be load balanced with _round robin_. Allthough,
`casual` will try to _route_ the same transaction to the previous _associated_ connectino with the specific transaction. 
This is only done to minimize the amount of _resources_ involved within the prepare and commit/rollback stage.  


property       | description
---------------|----------------------------------------------------
address        | the address to connect to, `host:port` 
services       | services we're expecting to find on the other side 
queues         | queues we're expecting to find on the other side 

`services` and `queues` is used as an _optimization_ to do a _build_ discovery during startup. `casual`
will find these services later lazily otherwise. It can also be used to do some rudimentary load balancing 
to make sure lower prioritized connections are used for `services` and `queues` that could be discovered in
higher prioritized connections.

## examples 

Below follows examples in human readable formats that `casual` can handle
