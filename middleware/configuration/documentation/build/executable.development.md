# configuration build-executable

[//]: # (Attention! this is a generated markdown from casual-configuration-documentation - do not edit this file!)

Defines user configuration when building a casual executable.

### resources

Defines which `xa` resources to link and use runtime. A name **has** to be provided for each 
resource, startup configuration phase will ask for resource configuration for that 
given name.

### entrypoint

Defines the name of the user provided _entry point_. The signature has to be the same as a
normal main function `int <entrypoint-name>( int argc, char** argv)`.

`casual` defines the actual `main` function, and executes the startup procedure, to configure
resources and such, then invoke the `entrypoint`, and all the control is left to user. As if 
the `entrypoint` was the `main` function.

## examples 

Below follows examples in human readable formats that `casual` can handle

### yaml
```` yaml
---
executable:
  resources:
    - key: "rm-mockup"
      name: "resource-1"
      note: "the runtime configuration for this resource is correlated with the name 'resource-1' - no group is needed for resource configuration"
  entrypoint: "start"
