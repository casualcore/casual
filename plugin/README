1. Set environment for casual. i.e CASUAL_BUILD_HOME

2. Download current version of nginx from http://nginx.org/download/ and build it.

Example:

prompt$ wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.5.2.tar.gz
prompt$ tar xvf nginx-1.5.2.tar.gz
prompt$ cd nginx-1.5.2/
prompt$ ./configure --with-cc-opt=-Wno-deprecated --add-module=$CASUAL_BUILD_HOME/plugin [perhaps also with --without-http_rewrite_module]
prompt$ make
prompt$ sudo make install

nginx are installed under /usr/local/nginx by default.

3. Edit /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

At the moment the nginx worker process must execute with the same user as casual.

Add statement (or change) user.
Ex.
user  myuser staff;

Add location /casual to appropriate server entry.
Ex.
        location /casual {
                casual_pass;
        }
